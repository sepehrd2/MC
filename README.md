# MC

The Montec-Carlo (MC) code here is capable of simulating Lenard-Jones (LJ) particles. The temprature, number of particles, size of the box, and MC related paramteres can be changed by the users. By changing the temperature one can see the phase transition of particles. The MC code can be extended to other systems as well.
